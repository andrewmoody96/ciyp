      Started while attending Millikin University, the band took advantage of
      the many amenities that the school of music had to offer and started
      releasing their music. After establishing a successful following at
      Millikin, Chocolate released their most popular single to date, "Bradford
      Baby", which currently sits at more than 500,000 streams worldwide.
