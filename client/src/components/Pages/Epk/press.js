        "CIYP did a fantastic job of adapting their set to our audience. The
        band has a musical style that is fresh and unique while still being able
        to reach those outside of their main demographic of listeners. Their
        chemistry throughout their performance with each other is fun and
        engaging. Working with CIYP was a treat, and I am looking forward to
        booking again in the future." <br></br><br></br>- Deerfield Park District<br></br><br></br>
